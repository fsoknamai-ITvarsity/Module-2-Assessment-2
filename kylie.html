                        <h3>KYLIE COSMETICS</h3>
                       <p>Kylie Cosmetics, LLC is an American cosmetics company founded by Kylie Jenner. The company began selling Kylie Lip Kits, a liquid lipstick and lip liner set, on November 30, 2015. Formerly known as Kylie Lip Kits, the company was renamed Kylie Cosmetics.</p>
                       <p>New updated line features all of my favorite iconic Lip Kit shades as well as my must-haves including blushes, bronzers, highlighters, high glosses, matte liquid lipsticks, lip blushes, brow essentials and eyeliners. Everything is clean, vegan, with ingredients that are good for your skin, but I made sure we didn’t sacrifice quality, pigmentation or performance. For me, being able to have a lasting matte lip formula that wasn’t overly drying, was so important when reformulating my Lip Kit. My new formula has 8 hour wear and lasting color but is super comfortable on the lips.</p>
