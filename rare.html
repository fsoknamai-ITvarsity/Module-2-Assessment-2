                        <h3>RARE BEAUTY</h3>
                       <p>Rare Beauty is makeup made to feel good in, without hiding what makes you unique.</p>
                       <p> Makeup has historically been used to cover up imperfections, but Rare takes an entirely different approach. “Rare Beauty is really about flipping that narrative and accepting what makes you unique and accepting your imperfections," says Cohen. “We believe that makeup is something to enjoy, not something that you need." </p>
